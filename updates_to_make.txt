Updates I would make if I had more time

1. Use additional frameworks (like React or Node.js) to make handling the game easier. 

2. Undo button - I set this up as a function taht works internally. I also didn't have time to 
set it to undo a "Guess Word" move. I had intended to use a simple conditional
statement to handle that piece of the game.

However, the version I designed does not rely on caching game-play in the browser. This means my
"Undo" doesn't redirect the browser to the URL for the previous turn. This also made it difficult
to handle these additional requirements: Bookmarking and Sharing. Given more time I would handled 
events on the server using a different .js script and something like Redis to store game-play
statistics. Overall, the direction I went was simpler but was unable to meet all requirements.
