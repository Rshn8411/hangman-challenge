Updates I would make if I had more time

1. Use additional frameworks (like React.js) to make handling the game easier. 

2. I didn't have time to set the "Undo" function to undo a "Guess Word" move. So, guessing the
full word can still only be done once per game. I had intended to use a simple conditional
statement to handle that piece of the game.
